## Useful resources

- **PCPartPicker**: [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) is a great resource for making parts lists for your PC. Parts lists can be saved and shared for feedback, and when the time comes to buy your parts it checks the prices at the major tech retailers and tells you where the best price is. It also has some basic compatibility checks, though they currently aren't always completely reliable so it's always worth doing a manual check!
