## Structure

This repository is structured to make the associated [GitHub pages site](https://neweggtechie.github.io/) easy to navigate.
Every major topic area will have its own directory with a `README.md` file that serves as a basic overview to that topic and 
contains links to more in depth information, tables, files, etc. For example, a `gpu` directory could contain `README.md` with
links to other files, such as Pato's `buyingGuide.md`, `specs.md`, a link to the newegg shuffle, etc.
