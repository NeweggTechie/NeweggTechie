# Code of Conduct

## The Rules

All rules of the [Newegg Discord](https://discord.gg/newegg) apply here. Violation of these rules can lead to a temporary or permanent ban from the server,
depending on severity. Punishments are ultimately up to the moderation staffs’ discretion. Please listen to Admins, Mods, and Staff.
If they ask you to stop a certain action, please follow their request, even if it dose not represent one of the rules below.

Please note that the rules have been slightly modified to make them fit the change in environment between a discord server and a GitHib repository.

1. Be respectful. Personal attacks, harassment, trolling, derogatory language towards any particular groups or race, gender, ect., 
  is not allowed and will lead to a ban.
2. We welcome members of all ages, so try to keep discussions at a PG-13 level and avoid swearing. If your username, status, 
  or profile pic is NSFW, it may be changed or you may be kicked/banned.
3. Don't misrepresent yourself as a Newegg employee or affiliated person. ALL NEWEGG TEAM MEMBERS WILL HAVE THE NEWEGG STAFF TAG.
4. Don't post NSFW images, videos, or links in chat. In addition, please do not encourage and share ways to pirate software, games, etc.
  Feel free to ask a Newegg team member if you have any questions about this.
5. We all love tech, but we understand that you may want to talk about something else. If so, please avoid discussing controversial 
  and sensitive topics such as politics or religion.
6. Just be cool, we are all here to have fun and share our love for games and hardware. Don't be a jerk, jerks suck.
7. Our goal is to create an awesome tech community where anyone can talk about the latest in greatest in the tech world. However,
  we understand that you may have joined the server to receive customer service assistance. If this is the case, please visit the
  #faqs channel to find the appropriate channels to get help. 
8. By posting images to Newegg’s Discord Server, you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to
  the image(s) you post, that you have the authority to grant rights to the images you post, and that you grant Newegg an irrevocable,
  perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free worldwide right and license to use, copy, modify, adapt,

10. Have your own Twitch/Mixer/YouTube/etc. channel and want to self-promote? Share it on #link-selfpromotion in the [Newegg Discord](https://discord.gg/newegg).
  However, we do not allow links to other Discord servers. This rule also applies to all other channels.﻿
11. For our issues, pull requests, etc., channels, please remember to follow the same rules as above and any mention of trolling or abuse
  of the voice channels will lead to immediate action.
12. If you have a tech question, please ask it on the [Newegg Discord server](https://discord.gg/newegg)! Try not to DM our Staff, Mods/Mod Trainees,
  or Techies unless asked to. If you have a customer service question, please DM NeweggService, do not DM Mods/Mod Trainees, or Techies.
